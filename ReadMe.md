A Quiz app
Create a quiz app that randomly displays a question with a multiple choice of answers to the user. If the user gets the answer correct, display a “hurray!” message, update their score, you get the idea. I like this app as the possibilities are endless when it comes to expanding on it:


- [x] Add categories
- [x] Add high scores
- [x] Add a countdown
- [x] Allow multiple players (HINT: You could go really advanced and use Socket.io to allow online play!)
- [ ] Win Badges
